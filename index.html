    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Space Ball</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of interaction, objects and classes, and randomness. This is a two player
	game in which players can interact with the object, in this case the ball, using
	either the W,A,S,D keys for player 1, or the arrow keys for player 2.
	I have also implemented an element of randomness as the direction in which the ball
	is released in each new 'kick-off' is random as is the colour of the ball in each new
	game.
	I have also made this a more engaging experience through the use of custom sprites and
	images, as well as sound effects.
