                <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Space Ball</h3>
                <p>
                    My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at
                    City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding
                    of the use of interaction, objects and classes, and randomness. This is a two player
                    game in which players can interact with the object, in this case the ball, using
                    either the W,A,S,D keys for player 1, or the arrow keys for player 2.
                    I have also implemented an element of randomness as the direction in which the ball
                    is released in each new 'kick-off' is random as is the colour of the ball in each new
                    game.
                    I have also made this a more engaging experience through the use of custom sprites and
                    images, as well as sound effects.

                <h3>Lost In Space - Java Project 2021</h3>
                <p>
                    My Java project for module IN1007 at City (2021).
					This Java project is 2D platforming game, 
					and demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces, abstract classes, event handling, polymorphism, graphical user interfaces and many more aspects of object-oriented programming.
					Each level in the game has its own background image and theme music and all collisions within the game are accompanied by sound effects.
					The images and sound effects used are consistent with the theme of the game and creates a more engaging experience for the player.
					There are also three availabe save slots for the player to utilise and save their progress throughout the game.
					Overall, creating this game was a fun and rewarding experience as I have learnt many new concepts in object-oriented programming through a project that was fun to develop and one that I take great pride in.
